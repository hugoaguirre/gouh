I'm a Cloud Software Engineer at Intel that helped building [Intel's Performance Hub](https://performancehub.intel.com) backend being a co-owner of one of the core microservices that interacted with AWS SSM to safely execute workloads on customer managed instances. 

Currently I am focusing more in the CI/CD side of projects and learning how to make a devs life easier within my organization.

On my early days I started as an Embedded Software Engineer at Continental Automotive working with Qualcomm's chipsets but that's a long and dark story for another time.

In my free time I play the accordion and tennis, so you might see random posts here and there about that.
