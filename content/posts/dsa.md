So, I've been grinding LeetCode ([Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/)) and plenty of [DesignGurus](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-coding-interview). My plan is to get better at problem solving and revive the old days at College where all these topics were the only thing we talked about.

My intention with the knowledge that I get from this grinding is to write down some tips and tricks for the things that I learn.

I won't post solutions to problems or so, instead I will try to talk about each pattern for example: how to use them or when to use them.

My first post of this series of post will be the Two Pointers since this is the most basic approach for DSA.

Keep grinding folks!
Cheers.
