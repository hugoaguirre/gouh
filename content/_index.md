![Profile Pic]()

I'm a Cloud Software Engineer at [Intel](https://performancehub.intel.com) working in a SaaS in the back-end of few microservices, their infra (IaaC) and co-responsible of the CI/CD of the project. On my early days I started being an Embedded Software Engineer at Continental Automotive working with Qualcomm's chipsets but that's a long and dark story for another time.

In my free time I play the accordion and tennis, so you might see random posts here and there about the accordion.
